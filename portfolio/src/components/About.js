      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p className='alignp'>Hello! Iâ€™m Karuna Pawar, a driven Full-Stack Developer currently based in Indore. With a strong academic background in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Jai Narain College of Technology, Bhopal, I've achieved a CGPA of 8.77. My journey in tech began with internships at Walkover Web Solutions, where I thrived as a Software Development Engineer Intern and a Quality Analyst Intern. My roles involved enhancing viaSocket by resolving critical bugs, improving design, and implementing user-friendly features like scrolling and a share button.

Beyond my technical skills in technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Bootstrap, I am passionate about creating seamless user experiences and robust functionalities. My projects, like the Word Counter and TO DO List app, reflect my ability to integrate functionality with aesthetics, utilizing React state, props, and keys to deliver interactive and functional applications.

I also pride myself on being an effective communicator and leader, demonstrated during my tenure as Head Student Coordinator of the Energy Club at college. Here, I organized and anchored events that cultivated community and spirited engagement.

Let's connect and explore how we can create impactful tech solutions together!</p>
